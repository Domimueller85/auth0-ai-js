# Auth0 AI for JavaScript

[Auth0 AI](https://www.auth0.ai/) helps you build secure AI-powered applications
that operate on behalf of a person.

Developers are using LLMs to build generative AI applications that deliver
powerful new experiences for customers and employees.  Maintaining security and
privacy while allowing AI agents to assist people in their work and lives is a
critical need.  Auth AI helps you meet these requirements, ensuring that agents
are properly authorized when taking actions or accessing resources on behalf of
a person.  Common use cases include:

- **User authentication**: Easily implement login experiences, tailor made for
  AI agents and assistants.
	
- **Call APIs on users' behalf**: Use secure standards to call APIs from tools,
  integrating your app with other products.
	
- **Authorization for RAG**: Generate more relevant responses while ensuring
  that the agent is only incorporating information that the user has access to.
	
- **Async User Confirmation**: Allow agents to operate autonomously in the
  background while requiring human approval when needed.
