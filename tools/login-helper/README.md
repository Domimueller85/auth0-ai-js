# Login Helper

This is a simple function to log in a user from a CLI application using a standard Web Application client from Auth0.

This is not intended for production use.

In a production environment, you would typically use the Device Code Flow.

We are not using the Device Flow here in order to simplify the demos for users and require only a single client.
