/**
 * Demonstrates the usage of the OKTA FGA (Fine-Grained Authorization)
 * with a vector store index to query documents with permission checks.
 *
 * It performs the following steps:
 *    1. Defines a user ID.
 *    2. Reads documents from a data source.
 *    3. Creates a VectorStoreIndex from the documents.
 *    4. Sets up a query engine with an FGARetriever to enforce permissions.
 *    5. Executes a query and logs the response.
 *
 * The FGARetriever checks if the user has the "viewer" relation to the document
 * based on predefined tuples in OKTA FGA.
 *
 * Example:
 * - A tuple {user: "user:*", relation: "viewer", object: "doc:doc1"} allows all users to view "doc1".
 * - A tuple {user: "user:user1", relation: "viewer", object: "doc:doc2"} allows "user1" to view "doc2".
 *
 * The output of the query depends on the user's permissions to view the documents.
