## Authorization for Tools with Okta FGA

Authorization for Tools ensures that users can only execute actions they are permitted to perform or access resources they are authorized to view. These examples demonstrate how to integrate **Okta FGA** with **LangChain**, **LlamaIndex**, **Genkit** and others to enforce authorization checks during AI Tool executions.

### How It Works

1. **User Query**: A user submits a query requiring the execution of a tool.
2. **Authorization Check**: Auth0 FGA verifies the user's permissions, erroring when the user is not authorized to execute certain action.
3. **Response Generation**: The system generates a response tailored to the user's access level.
