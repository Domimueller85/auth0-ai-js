> [!WARNING]
> Auth0 AI is currently **under heavy development**. We strictly follow [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/), meaning all **breaking changes will only occur in major versions**. However, please note that during this early phase, **major versions may be released frequently** as the API evolves. We recommend locking versions when using this in production.

This package contains helper methods for the [Cloudflare Agents](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/) SDK. 

Please note that most examples for Cloudflare Agents use the [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/).

We will provide a full sample and template to get started with Cloudflare Agents.

## Installation

```
npm i @auth0/ai-cloudflare @auth0/ai-vercel @auth0/ai
```

## Usage

Replace `useAgentChat` with `useAgentChatInterruptions` in your code to get access to `toolInterrupt`.

```js
  const {
    messages: agentMessages,
    input: agentInput,
    handleInputChange: handleAgentInputChange,
    handleSubmit: handleAgentSubmit,
    addToolResult,
    clearHistory,
    toolInterrupt,
  } = useAgentChatInterruptions({
    agent,
    maxSteps: 5,
    id: threadID,
  });
```
